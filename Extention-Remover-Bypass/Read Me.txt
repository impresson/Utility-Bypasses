--READ ME vPR-0.1
--Extention Removal Bypass vPR0.1
KEEP THESE FILES IN YOUR DOWNLOADS!!!

Hello this is a information board about how to use this extention remover.

-- How it works
It deletes the files for a extention but once it get's deleted it wont show up and will no longer function.
Google chrome will try to "reinstall" this extention and will therefore not work. But make sure to follow the
instructions in order for it to work.

-- Patcher instuctions
Open up a text editor and open up that file. We recoment using notepad as it is easy.
A quick way to do this is to right click on the "Patcher.bat" file and click edit.

Next we will need to open up Command prompt.
A way to do this is to Type "Windows+R" Then type "cmd"

next we want to copy the thing that says C:\Users\(WE NEED TO COPY THIS)>
Now you can close it and open up notepad back.

Find where it says "(INSERT USER HERE)" and replace that with what you copied.

Next it will get a bit complicated.
You will need type "Windows+R" and then type "%appdata%"
click on (top) local -> userdata
now click on one of the profiles. depending usually on the order click on one of the profiles.< - here
click on "Extentions"									            |
now find try click on a extention and see if it is the same version|
If It's not there try goto another profile and repeat it from - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - -/
Once you have found it make sure to to remember the profile number
Open up the text editor again and replace (YOUR CHROME PROFILE) with "Profile" and your number with a space (Profile (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 etc))
Now your done!

-- How to run
Before you run make sure chrome is fully closed. Even end it's task if it doesn't work.
Make sure to first run "Patcher.bat" and then once the program exits run "Bypass.bat"
Follow the instructions from the "Bypass.bat" And you have succesfully removed that extention!

]----------{ FAQ }----------[

--Why is this useful?
This can be useful when your people can monitor your screen using a extention or track a website your on using a extention.
When these extentions are added by admins. You don't really stand a chance. But once you use this it becomes a self defence option.

--Who are you targeting?
I am not targeting anyone(or anything) really. It is a option of a privacy focused extention remover bypass.

--It doesn't work?
You can dm me from either
Best option - Discord: Pigeon#4043 or @theofficialpigeon
or an alternative - Discord - @impresson

--I cant find my profile.
1. If that was your main profile it doesn't work yet.
2. If you don't know which one is which then try searching for the extention versions or something related to that profile

--Can't I do this manually
Yes you can.
First copy the folder "PR-0.1"
Then type "Windows+R" then type %appdata% then select (on the top) Local.
Click on "Google -> Chrome -> User Data -> (Your Chrome Profile) -> Extentions -> (Whatever extention you're willing to reomve)".
Delete every folder & paste "PR-0.1"
Now you can run "bypass.bat"
And your extention is removed. :>

Note: This is a pre-release(PR) version and will allow more extentions to be removed and effeciently
